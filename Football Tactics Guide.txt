Football Tactics Guide by Gor≈°tak
a) Pick mentality depending on central triangles..

DM + MC + AMC present = defensive
DM present = counter
MC missing = standard
DM missing = control
DM + AMC missing = attacking

b) Pick your duties by depending on fluidity

highly structured = 0-1 support duties
structured = 2-3 support duties
flexible = 4-5 support duties
fluid = 6-7 support duties
very fluid = 8-9 support duties

c) Pick your fluidity depending on lines in your formation missing (don't forget SW)

0 lines missing = highly structured
1 line missing = structured
2 lines missing = flexible
3 lines missing = fluid
4 lines missing = very fluid

e) Fluidity and mentality concerns

more fluid = better individual quality, better teamwork, better decisions, more chances created, pressing defence, good with referee
less fluid = focus on job at hand, soak up pressure defence, dumb player decisions that may result with penalties or cards
more agressive = more shots, more injuries, worse fitness, good at crosses, susceptible to through balls, more shots converted to goals
less agressive = fewer shots,  less injuries, better fitness, good at through balls, susceptible to crosses, you rarely score
medium fluidity and mentality = no obvious pros, susceptible to set pieces, match outcome will likely be a draw

f) Mentality efficiency

Attacking = efficient at start of match
Control = efficient between 20th to 40th minute
Standard = efficient at around half time
Counter = efficient between 60th to 80th minute
Defensive = efficient at end of match

g) Fluidity efficiency

Very fluid = efficient at start of match
Fluid = efficient between 20th and 40th minute
Flexible = efficient around halftime
Structured = efficient between 60th and 80th minute
Highly structured = efficient at end of match

h) When and where to use each fluidity

fluid = Premier and Championship league
flexible = League 1 and 2
structured = conference leagues
highly structured = amateur and sunday leagues

i) Pick your most efficient spot depending on fluidity and mentality, and if that spot is occupied with a player, make sure he is top class.

1a. highly stuructured = left
1b. structured = central left
1c. flexible = center
1d. fluid = central right
1e. very fluid = right

2a. overload = GK
2b. attacking = SW
2c. control = CB
2d. standard = DM
2e. counter = MC
2f. defensive = AMC
2g. contain = ST

j) How is it played out?

a) offensive tactic = offensive tactic means you are pushing players up from deep. If you are remaining deep, lines must be straight so everyone has space.
Players use agression to start on opponents and initiate a counter attack. Tempo is high, meaning players keep the ball shorter and passes are longer, direct.
In offense, it resembles piggy in the middle style. Width is very wide, so you use it to stretch the opposition and create space to shoot. 
You shoot from deep often, do crosses and make the opponent chase you around the pitch.

b) Defensive tactic = Part of defense is to keep opponent far from your goal. So you play narrower, keep the ball longer, 
dribble with the ball and create chance after chance in oponenents half. It looks as if you are dominating and is often mistaken for offensive tactic. 
A DM is used as anchor to try to thwart counter attacks while your team is in opponents half.
